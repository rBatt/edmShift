__Empirical data methods applied to ecosystem regime shifts__

Contributors: Ryan Batt, Emily Klein, Malin Pinsky, Steve Carpenter ...

This project aims to use empirical data methods (EDM) to gain a better understanding of ecosystem regime shifts. Because EDM are relatively new and unfamiliar to most ecologists, our first goal is to apply EDM to simulated data sets in order to understand what this powerful technique can tell us about a system in/ transitioning between alternative stable states. Next we aim to apply EDM to field experiments that induced regime shifts. Finally, we will use EDM evaluate time series of coastal marine species from around North America.

That being said, edmShift is an ever-evolving project, and its structure and goals will likely change over time.
