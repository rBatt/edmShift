__R scripts for simulating time series__

These should be top level simulation scripts; when finalized, they should not: include functions, generate figures, conduct statistical analyses.

Food web model (trophic cascade) is from [Carpenter et al. 2008 in Ecology Letters](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01131.x/full), other versions can be seen in [Biggs et al. 2009 PNAS](http://www.pnas.org/content/106/3/826.short) and [Carpenter et al. 2014 in Oikos](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00539.x/full). The latter of these is what I refer to as the "QD" set of parameters (QD stands for "quickest detection").
